# World_Weather_Analysis

This is a beta for my theoretical app "PlanMyTrip". This beta has testers use input statements to filter the data for their vacation ideal weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. This app also uses the Google Maps Directions API, which can be used to create a travel route between cities as well. My example code uses four cities in Indonesia.
